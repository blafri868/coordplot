# coordplot
An application to learn android development

## Week 1
- Created a simple android project that moves a dot on a map using two sliders. One slider controls the x-axis and the other slider controls the y-axis

## Week 2
- Replaced the dot to mark the spot on the map with an icon.
- Added labels to the sliders to tell the user what axis the slider controls and what is the current percent.
- In landscape orientation the screen uses a horizontal arrangement instead of the column arrangement it uses in portrait mode.
- Themed the application using the color and theme kotlin files in the ui.theme directory.
- Gave the application a custom splash screen.
